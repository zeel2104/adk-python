# Simple Live (Bidi-Streaming) Agent with Parallel Tools
This project provides a basic example of a live, [bidirectional streaming](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/) agent that demonstrates parallel tool execution.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the agent up and running:

1.  **Start the ADK Web Server**
    Open your terminal, navigate to the root directory that contains the
    `live_bidi_streaming_parallel_tools_agent` folder, and execute the following
    command:
    ```bash
    adk web
    ```

2.  **Access the ADK Web UI**
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL 
    provided in the terminal (it will typically be `http://localhost:8000`).

3.  **Select the Agent**
    In the top-left corner of the ADK Web UI, use the dropdown menu to select 
    this agent (`live_bidi_streaming_parallel_tools_agent`).

4.  **Start Streaming**
    Click on the **Audio** icon located near the chat input 
    box to begin the streaming session.

5.  **Interact with the Agent**
    You can now begin talking to the agent, and it will respond in real-time.
    Try asking it to perform multiple actions at once, for example: "Turn on the
    lights and the TV at the same time." The agent will be able to invoke both
    `turn_on_lights` and `turn_on_tv` tools in parallel.

## Usage Notes

* You only need to click the **Audio** button once to initiate the
 stream. The current version does not support stopping and restarting the stream
  by clicking the button again during a session.
